INSTRUCTIONS FOR REMOTE API CLIENT
By Solborg

1) Create a puppet nation as your controller. What you put as the motto, national animal, and currency will affect the API client.

2) Encrypt your client key using TEA (go to encrypt.html). Remember the encryption key! Enter the ciphertext as your control nation's motto.

3) Encrypt your secret key using the same encryption key. Enter the ciphertext as your control nation's national animal.

4) Change your currency to: "TGID + MODE" without the quotes. Replace TGID with your TGID (do not encrypt it!). Replace MODE with one of these:
    - on: Send telegrams
    - off: Pause sending (can be turned back on)
    - stop: Terminate the program, requires manual restarting

5) Fill out the text boxes on the Remote Telegram API Client page, and click begin.

Things to know:

1) This client only works for targeting new nations with recruitment telegrams.

2) If you make a change to the motto, national animal, or currency while the program is running, your control nation will receive an automated telegram.

3) To see a more detailed outline of what the program is doing, open your browser console while it is running.
