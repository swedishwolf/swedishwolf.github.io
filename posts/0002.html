<h2>What is libertarianism?</h2>
<i>Written 23 June 2016</i>
<p>From an American perspective, libertarianism is a strictly right-wing ideology that advocates for minimal government in all aspects, especially when it comes to social services and welfare. Rand Paul, former Republican presidential candidate, often comes to mind when thinking about libertarians. Other countries have parties, like UKIP in the UK, that claim to be libertarian as well but are actually far from it.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is an ideology for the promotion of personal freedoms and rights. A libertarian would support minimal government involvement in people's personal lives and extensive civil freedoms such as freedom of speech, the right to choose, and the abolition of laws restricting marriage. The opposite of libertarianism would be authoritarianism, where people would have to act and think as the government tells them.</p>
<p>The place where people get confused is the economic factor. Personal freedoms are not the same as economic freedoms; this is illustrated beautifully with the <a href="http://politicalcompass.org" target="_blank">Political Compass</a>. The rights of the person are not the same as the rights of the corporation. There are both left- and right-wing variants of libertarianism, their extremes being anarchism. On the Political Compass, anarcho-capitalists, often called “ancaps”, would fit into the lower right corner, while social anarchists would fit into the lower left. I, being a moderate left-wing libertarian, scored near the bottom, slightly to the left of the economic center.</p>
<p>The very politicians who most people consider to be “libertarian” are nowhere near where their labels imply. Rand Paul is certainly far-right, but he is barely on the libertarian side of the dividing line. UKIP isn’t anywhere close; they’re up in the top right. In many countries, the Green Party is actually the most libertarian, but they’re usually not that close to the bottom.</p>
<p>Who are the real libertarians, then? In many cases, this is the Pirate Party. In Germany and Iceland, the latter of which being a place of significant popularity, they are fairly far down on the spectrum, and close to the economic center.</p>
<p>I hope this cleared up any misconceptions you may have had! Have a nice day.</p>
