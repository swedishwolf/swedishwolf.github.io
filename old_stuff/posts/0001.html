<h2>Creation of the Website</h2>
<i>Written 22 June 2016</i>
<p>As you can see, I have created a website. Here, I will be posting all sorts of content that interests me. It is a very simple website, and I intend to keep it that way. Minimalism is key. Its navigation is pretty self-explanatory. The posts are not currently organized into any categories or anything, but I may add such features in the future. For now, just enjoy it.</p>
<p>What exactly will I be posting? I honestly have no idea. I just created this as a fun little project, so it may actually never be used. Hopefully it will.</p>
